## Introduction

React Router is a powerful library for routing in React applications. It allows developers to create a seamless navigation experience by enabling dynamic routing based on the URL. This tutorial aims to provide practical examples and hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding of React Router's core features.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
- Basic understanding of React.js and JavaScript

## Installation

To get started with this tutorial, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-router-tutorial.git
cd react-router-tutorial
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Getting Started

To run the tutorial application locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Core Concepts

### BrowserRouter

The `BrowserRouter` component is the primary router used in React Router. It uses the HTML5 history API to keep the UI in sync with the URL.

### Routes and Route

The `Routes` and `Route` components define the different routes in your application. Each route maps a URL path to a specific component.

### Link and NavLink

Use the `Link` component to create navigational links that allow users to navigate between routes. The `NavLink` component can be used for styling active links.

### Nested Routes

Learn how to implement nested routes to create a hierarchy of routes within your application.

### Redirects

Implement redirects to automatically send users from one route to another based on certain conditions.

### Route Parameters

Discover how to use route parameters to pass dynamic data in the URL.

### Programmatic Navigation

Learn how to navigate programmatically using the `useNavigate` hook.

## Advanced Topics

### Custom 404 Page

Create a custom 404 page to handle unmatched routes gracefully.

### Protected Routes

Implement protected routes that restrict access to certain parts of your application based on user authentication.

## Examples

This repository contains several examples demonstrating each of the concepts mentioned above. You can find them in the `src/examples` directory.
